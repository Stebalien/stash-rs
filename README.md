# Stash

Stash is a library for storing items where you need (amortized) `O(1)`
insertion, deletion, and lookups but don't care about the order of the items and
don't need to be able to choose the keys.

Please see the [API](https://stebalien.github.io/rust-stash/stash/)
documentation for a more detailed description.
